              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves
              1
              and in the first imaging of a black hole
              2
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The focus of the paper is on path-based assignment, which is essential in the implementation of route choice models. The paper analyzes the effect of choice set size and selected choice models on problem convergence, running time and selected results. The results presented in the paper indicate that for real-size networks, generation of a large number of alternative routes is needed. Furthermore, convergence properties greatly improve if the generated routes are sufficiently disjointed.},

To compute turn probabilities, however, a topological ordering of the nodes is needed, which negatively impacts the stability of convergence and consistency of equilibrium. This paper formulates a general framework for the RC module of the efficient stochastic DTA (ESDTA) without topological ordering; we demonstrate how its full fixed route yields smooth and consistent convergence. The theoretical framework requires a series of computational modifications to ensure that numerical errors remain limited and to make the formulation more efficient for use in practice. The resulting ESDTA's computation time to reach equilibrium scales linearly with respect to all relevant complexity dimensions (network size, demand zones, time resolution, and congestion level).},

In this paper, the profiles of cumulative flows are piecewise linearized. Both the step function (SF) and linear interpolation (LI) are used to approximate cumulative flows over time. New formulations of the SF-type and LI-type link travel time models are developed. We prove that these two types of link travel time models ensure first-in-first-out (FIFO) and continuity of travel times with respect to flows, and have other desirable properties. Since the LI-type link travel time model does not satisfy the causality property, a modified LI-type (MLI-type) link travel time model is proposed in this paper. We prove that the MLI-type link travel time model ensures causality, strong FIFO and travel time continuity, and that the MLI-type link travel time function is strictly monotone under the condition that the travel time of each vehicle on a link is greater than the free flow travel time on that link. Numerical examples are set up to illustrate the properties and accuracy of the three models.},

OSMnx contributes five significant capabilities for researchers and practitioners: first, the automated downloading of political boundaries and building footprints; second, the tailored and automated downloading and constructing of street network data from OpenStreetMap; third, the algorithmic correction of network topology; fourth, the ability to save street networks to disk as shapefiles, GraphML, or SVG files; and fifth, the ability to analyze street networks, including calculating routes, projecting and visualizing networks, and calculating metric and topological measures. These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures of the structure and topology of the network. Finally, this article presents a simple case study using OSMnx to construct and analyze street networks in Portland, Oregon.},

	abstract = {In this paper a novel iterative algorithm is presented for the link transmission model, a fast macroscopic dynamic network loading scheme. The algorithm's solutions are defined on a space–time discretized grid. Unlike previous numerical schemes there is no hard upper limit on the time step size for the algorithm to be numerically stable, leaving only the trade-off between accuracy and interpolation errors. This is a major benefit because mandatory small time steps in existing algorithm (required for numerical tractability) are undesirable in most strategic analyses. They lead to highly increased memory costs on larger network instances and unnecessary complex behaviour. In practice results are often aggregated for storage or analysis, which leads to the loss of computationally expensive detailed information and to the introduction of inconsistencies. The novel iterative scheme is consistent with the modelling assumptions independent of the numerical time step. A second contribution of the iterative procedure is the smart handling of repeated runs, which can be initialized (or warm started) by an earlier solution. For applications, repeatedly loading a network is often needed when evaluating traffic states under changing variables or adjusted parameter settings, or in optimization and equilibration procedures. In these cases the iterative algorithm is initialized with the solution of a previous run and iterations are performed to find a new consistent solution. Pseudo-code is provided for both a basic upwind iterative scheme and an extended algorithm that significantly accelerates convergence. The most important computational gains are achieved by ordering and reducing calculations to that part of the network which has changed (most). The properties of the algorithm are demonstrated on a theoretical network as well as on some real-world networks.},

Trafﬁc assignment models share the same theoretical framework (DNA), but differ in capability (genes). We argue that all trafﬁc assignment models can be described by three genes. The ﬁrst gene determines the spatial capability (unrestricted, capacity restrained, capacity constrained, and capacity and storage constrained) described by four spatial assumptions (shape of the fundamental diagram, capacity constraints, storage constraints, and turn ﬂow restrictions). The second gene determines the temporal capability (static, semidynamic, and dynamic) described by three temporal assumptions (wave speeds, vehicle propagation speeds, and residual trafﬁc transfer). The third gene determines the behavioural capability (all-or-nothing, one shot, and equilibrium) described by two behavioural assumptions (decision-making and travel time consideration). This classiﬁcation provides a deeper understanding of the often implicit assumptions made in trafﬁc assignment models described in the literature. It further allows for comparing different models in terms of functionality, and paves the way for developing novel trafﬁc assignment models.},
