	abstract = {This paper presents a novel user-equilibrium (UE) traffic assignment algorithm, which under conventional assumptions, promises to compute UE arc flows to acceptable precision, regardless of the network’s topology, size or congestion:•The algorithm takes the simple approach of shifting flow from a costliest path to a cheapest path until the costs of all used paths are within a given ϵ of the cheapest.•Because of being path-based, it avoids tailing.•In spite of being path-based, it neither stores nor enumerates paths.•These efficiencies derive from decomposing the problem into a sequence of easy single-origin problems on acyclic sub-networks. Solutions to this sequence of sub-network flows converge rapidly to a sharp practical estimate of UE arc flows—as is amply demonstrated by tests using the Chicago region’s 40,000-arc network model.},

In this paper, the profiles of cumulative flows are piecewise linearized. Both the step function (SF) and linear interpolation (LI) are used to approximate cumulative flows over time. New formulations of the SF-type and LI-type link travel time models are developed. We prove that these two types of link travel time models ensure first-in-first-out (FIFO) and continuity of travel times with respect to flows, and have other desirable properties. Since the LI-type link travel time model does not satisfy the causality property, a modified LI-type (MLI-type) link travel time model is proposed in this paper. We prove that the MLI-type link travel time model ensures causality, strong FIFO and travel time continuity, and that the MLI-type link travel time function is strictly monotone under the condition that the travel time of each vehicle on a link is greater than the free flow travel time on that link. Numerical examples are set up to illustrate the properties and accuracy of the three models.},

              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves
              1
              and in the first imaging of a black hole
              2
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {In stochastic (dynamic) traffic assignment (DTA), route choice (RC) formulations with implicit route set require less memory than their explicit counterparts. To compute turn probabilities, however, a topological ordering of the nodes is needed, which negatively impacts the stability of convergence and consistency of equilibrium. This paper formulates a general framework for the RC module of the efficient stochastic DTA (ESDTA) without topological ordering; we demonstrate how its full fixed route yields smooth and consistent convergence. The theoretical framework requires a series of computational modifications to ensure that numerical errors remain limited and to make the formulation more efficient for use in practice. The resulting ESDTA's computation time to reach equilibrium scales linearly with respect to all relevant complexity dimensions (network size, demand zones, time resolution, and congestion level).},
